## Practice the concepts

This week's concepts can be challenging, therefore let's get an easy introduction using some interactive exercises! Check the following resources out and start practicing.

You can ignore anything to do with `XMLHttpRequest`

## Code along

Now that you've learned about APIs and how to connect with them, let's apply it in the context of a complete application.

In the following application you'll be making an API call to an external, public API.

Enjoy!

## Question

The following endpoint is publicly available from Github

    GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments

1. Describe in a sentence what this API endpoint returns.

   https://api.github.com/repos/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/pulls/699
   Amazing, this is my pull request in CodeYourFuture / js-exercises and my pull request number in #699
   Actuly comments doesnt work for me inested comments I used commits an show me all my commits in my pull request
   https://api.github.com/repos/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/pulls/699/commits

   Or this one is my tv show project api
   https://api.github.com/repos/AKaramifar/tv-show-dom-project

2. What would you put in the following fields? `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{pull_number}`?

   owner : user login
   repo : repository 
   pull_number : pull request number (for me it was #699 for week 7 pull request)
